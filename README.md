## Task Manager
A simple online task manager that allows you to view and create tasks.

This version allows you to navigate more easily and to remove task items. Basic CSS styling has been added via an external stylesheet in the `public` folder.

### Usage
From the root directory, run `bundle install` in your terminal window, then run `shotgun` to launch the server.

Navigate to `localhost:9393` and play around.

When finished, close the server in your command line with `Ctrl-C`.
